# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

_Goal_: Produce a high‑quality, **feature‑level** `specs/[###-feature]/research.md` that synthesizes historical research from `/specs/researches/` and resolves all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]`.

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** (above)

   - For each `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` → create a focused research question
   - For each dependency/integration → create a best‑practices or patterns question
   - For each performance/constraint item → define measurable targets to validate

2. **Harvest historical research (repo‑wide)**

   - Use the **research-locator** agent to scan **`/specs/researches/`** for related documents  
     _Prefer dated filenames like `YYYY-MM-DD-_.md`and ticketed forms`YYYY-MM-DD-ENG-XXXX-_.md`._
   - Select the **top 3–7** most relevant docs by **recency + topical match** (feature domain, technology, constraints)
   - Run the **research-analyzer** agent on those docs to extract:
     - **Key Decisions & Rationale**
     - **Constraints / Guardrails**
     - **Lessons Learned / Gotchas**
     - **Open / Deferred questions**
   - **Ignore superseded docs** (if marked in content/headers)
   - **Treat `/specs/researches/` as read‑only inputs.**  
     _(Do not confuse these with the feature’s own `research.md` output.)_

3. **Synthesize & de‑duplicate**

   - Merge historical insights with the current questions/unknowns
   - **Flag contradictions** or deltas vs. current context; propose resolution backed by sources
   - Convert applicable insights into draft entries for Decisions/Rationale/Alternatives
   - **Tag each insight with its source path**, e.g., `specs/researches/2025-01-08-authentication-flow.md`

4. **Write the feature‑level `research.md`** → `specs/[###-feature]/research.md`

   - **Summary** — what we learned and why it matters to this feature
   - **Historical Insights (from `/specs/researches`)**
     - One bullet per consulted doc: **path**, **date** (from filename/frontmatter), **1–2 line takeaway**
   - **Decisions**
     - _Decision_ / _Rationale_ / _Alternatives considered_ (cite relevant historical docs)
   - **Open Questions**
     - Should be **empty**; if not, **Phase 0 fails** and planning must pause
   - **References**
     - Canonical list of all consulted `specs/researches/*` files

5. **Validation (Gate)**
   - Historical research **consulted & referenced** (when available under `/specs/researches/`)
   - **No** `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` remain
   - Contradictions resolved or explicitly deferred with owner/date

**Output**: `specs/[###-feature]/research.md` complete with a **Historical Insights** section and citations to `/specs/researches/*`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
